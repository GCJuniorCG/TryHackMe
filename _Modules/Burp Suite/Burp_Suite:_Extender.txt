Welcome to the Burp Suite Extender room!
This room will focus on Burp Suite's modular aspects: the exposed functionality, which allows developers to craft extra additional modules for the framework.
Coding Burp modules is far outwith the scope of this module, but we will take a quick look at the API documentation, as well as going over the typical process for adding new modules using the Burp Suite "BApp" store.
You will not need the target machine to complete this room, but you should ensure that you have access to a copy of Burp Suite. If you are using the AttackBox, make sure to start it now.
