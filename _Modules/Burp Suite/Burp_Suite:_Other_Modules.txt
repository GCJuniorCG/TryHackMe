Alongside the well-known Repeater and Intruder rooms, Burp Suite also has several slightly more obscure modules built-in: these are what we will be covering in this room.

Specifically, we will be looking at the Decoder, Comparer and Sequencer tools. These allow us to: work with encoded text; compare sets of text; and analyse the randomness of captured tokens, respectively. Being able to perform these relatively straightforward tasks directly within Burp Suite can save a lot of time, so it is well worth the time spent learning to use these modules efficiently.

Without further ado, let's jump in and start looking at Decoder!


Task 3
Answer the questions below

Base64 encode the phrase: Let's Start Simple.
What is the base64 encoded version of this text?
Answer: TGV0J3MgU3RhcnQgU2ltcGxl

URL Decode this data: %4e%65%78%74%3a%20%44%65%63%6f%64%69%6e%67.
What is the plaintext returned?
Answer: Next: Decoding

Use Smart Decode to decode this data: &#x25;&#x33;&#x34;&#x25;&#x33;&#x37;.
What is the decoded text?
Answer: 47

Encode this phrase: Encoding Challenge.
Start with base64 encoding. Take the output of this and convert it into ASCII Hex. Finally, encode the hex string into octal.
What is the final string?

Task 4
Answer the questions below

Using Decoder, what is the SHA-256 hashsum of the phrase: Let's get Hashing!?
Convert this into an ASCII Hex string for the answer to this question.
Answer: 6b72350e719a8ef5af560830164b13596cb582757437e21d1879502072238abe

Generate an MD4 hashsum of the phrase: Insecure Algorithms.
Encode this as base64 (not ASCII Hex) before submitting.

Let's look at an in-context example:
First, download the file attached to this task.
Note: This file can also be downloaded from the deployed VM with  wget http://MACHINE_IP:9999/AlteredKeys.zip -- you may find this useful if you are using the AttackBox.
Now read the problem specification below:
"Some joker has messed with my SSH key! There are four keys in the directory, and I have no idea which is the real one. The MD5 hashsum for my key is 3166226048d6ad776370dc105d40d9f8 -- could you find it for me?"
Submit the correct key name as your answer.
Answer: key3
